        hello, how are you and what about you. We all know that there is intensification of energy crisis
        all over the world. One way to solve the problem is to search the new energy and take advantage of
        the renewable energy. Solar energy is the most direct, common, and clean energy on our planet we 
        have already found until now. So, we are using the solar energy for our traffic management system.
        As of why we have used the solar energy. Let’s have a quick look.</p>

            <h2>hello world</h2>
            <p>We already know the basic principle behind the solar panel. The Photovoltaic (PV) cell is 
            composed of at least two layers of the semiconductors which have been “doped” with different 
            impurities. This makes an excess of free electrons (n-type) on one side of the junction, and 
            a lack of free electrons (p-type) on another side. When the photovoltaic cells are irradiated 
            with sunlight, some photons are reflected and the others are absorbed by the solar cell. When
            the photovoltaic cells keep enough photons, the negative electrons are released from the
            semiconductor material. Due to the manufacturing process of the positive layer, these free
            electrons naturally migrate to the positive layer which creates voltage differential. When the
            solar cell is connected with the external load, there will be a current circulation in the
            circuit.</p>
