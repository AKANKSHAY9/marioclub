        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>According to principle of photovoltaic effect, the solar panels receive solar radiation 
        during the day time and then convert it into electrical energy through the charge and discharge
        controller, which is finally stored in the battery. When the light intensity reduced to about 10
        lx during night and open circuit voltage of the solar panels reaches at a certain value, the
        controller has detected voltage value and then act, the Battery offer the energy to the display.
        It emits visible light at a certain direction. Battery discharges after certain time passes,
        the charge and discharge controller will act again to end the discharging of the battery in
        order to prepare next charging or discharging again.
